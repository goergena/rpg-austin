This is a character battle game made with jquery and styled with bootstrap. This is my first full project using objects! 

ABOUT THE GAME:
There are 4 characters. The user selects a character by clicking on one, which becomes the hero. The other 3 characters become enemies. Battle the enemies one-by-one to defeat them all and win the game.

To battle an enemy: clicking on an enemy will engage the enemy in combat and make that enemy the current challenger. The challenger's health points are displayed and an attack button appears. Each click of the attack button allows the hero to attack, decreasing the challenger's health points. Every time you attack, the challenger counterattacks, and the hero's hp takes damage. With each attack, the hero's attack gets stronger. When a challenger's health reaches 0 hp or below, it is defeated, and no longer able to counterattack. You can then select your next challenger. You cannot win battling in any order-- you need to battle the weaker opponents first in order to level up and beat the stronger ones. The characters are from My Little Pony, so use your MLP knowledge to guide you through. 
*spoiler- One character cannot lose. The imbalance isn't an error. Life is full of OPs. She's just one of them.
